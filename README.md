# 🐍 Snake Game (JavaScript)

This is a classic **Snake Game** implemented using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, built back in high school (3rd grade!).  
Move the snake around, eat fruits, grow your tail, and try not to crash into yourself!

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use **arrow keys** (⬅️⬆️➡️⬇️) to control the snake.
- Eat fruits (🍎) to grow longer and earn points.
- Avoid crashing into your own tail — otherwise, it's **Game Over**!

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the game elements (board, snake, fruit, score display).
- **CSS3**: Styling the game board, snake, and fruit.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**:
  - Dynamic movement of the snake.
  - Fruit spawning at random locations.
  - Collision detection.
  - Snake growth mechanics.
  - Score tracking and game restart.

---

## 📋 Notes

- The snake wraps around the screen if it hits a wall (teleport effect).
- Each time the snake eats a fruit, a new tail segment is added.
- Fruit never spawns on the snake's body.
- Collision with your own tail ends the game and displays "Game Over".
